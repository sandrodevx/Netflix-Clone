## Features

- **Movie Rows**: Displays rows of movies by category (e.g., Trending, Netflix Originals).
- **Search Bar**: Allows users to search for movies (functionality to be implemented).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
